# **Master regulators governing protein abundance\**

This package has two functions: **Network** and **MaPR**.

The **Network** function constructs a regulatory network of protein translation independent of transcriptional regulation by simultaneously using transcriptomic data and proteomic data of the same cohort. <br /><br />
The **MaPR** function predicts master protein abundance regulators based on the permutation of the constructed protein translation regulatory network.
