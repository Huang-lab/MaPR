# **Master Regulators of Protein Abundance across Ten Cancer Types**

[Citation of our manuscript if help you https://link.springer.com] Still in submission

This package have two functions: **Network** and **MaPR**.

**Network** function construct a regulatory network of protein translation independent of transcriptional regulation by simutaniously using transcriptomic data and protomic data of the same cohort. <br /><br />
**MaPR** function predict master protein abundance regulators based on permutation of constructed protein translation regulatory network.
